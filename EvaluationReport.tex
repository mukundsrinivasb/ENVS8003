\section*{Introduction}
% \subsection*{Background}

The World Economic Forum (\cite{masterson_2024})  outlines six key technologies critical for climate change adaptation, 
including the powerful roles of Earth Observation [EO] and Artificial Intelligence [AI]. 
EO sector plays a pivotal role in climate change mitigation by offering critical data for monitoring deforestation, land-use changes, and rising sea levels (\cite{anderson_2017}). 
However, as EO becomes more industrialized (\cite{venkatesan_2020}) , it presents several significant environmental risks that must be considered when evaluating its contribution to climate adaptation (\cite{crisp_2020}).

At the same time , the  Information and Communication Technology [ICT] sector that encompasses EO and AI
is responsible for over 3 percent of the world's carbon emissions (\cite{jones_2018}) . Specifically , 
companies like Samsung and Amazon had a footprint of around 40,000MT of \(CO_2\) equivalent in 2021 (\cite{navarro_2023_the}) —raises the question 
of how big tech companies are addressing their environmental impact. While AI and EO tools offer potential benefits in 
mitigating climate change, their carbon costs are often overlooked. For instance, AI models require massive computational power, 
and EO platforms consume vast amounts of energy through cloud-based infrastructure (\cite{taddeo_2021}).

Given the dual role of ICT as both a significant contributor to global carbon emissions and a 
key driver of climate change solutions, it is crucial to examine the adaptation strategies 
adopted by tech companies to mitigate their environmental impact. This report systematically 
evaluates the sustainability reports of major tech companies—Meta, Apple, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, 
Samsung and Dell—focusing on their key businesses, associated climate risks, and summaries of 
their adaptation strategies. Currently, no specific 
framework exists to evaluate these strategies in the tech sector, necessitating reliance on established climate change 
metrics. To this effect, the techniques outlined in the framework provided by the International Institute for Environment and Development 
will guide the evaluation, ensuring that these companies’ adaptation policies align with broader sustainability goals. The evaluation will utilize 
the scorecard suggested by the IIED (\cite{craft_2016}) for systematic reporting, along with the framework proposed in the article by Jones N. (\cite{jones_2001}) 
to assess the adaptation strategies of the selected companies effectively.


\section*{Methods}
Earth Observation [EO] plays a vital role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the 2030 Agenda. EO technologies help track, monitor, and report progress toward these goals by enabling data-driven decision-making, improving the accuracy of national statistics through spatially explicit data, and addressing cross-cutting themes such as climate and energy. The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) is pivotal in ensuring EO's practical application in supporting the 2030 Agenda, particularly through partnerships, as emphasized in Strategic Development Goal 17. EO's contributions to national planning and fostering synergy between various development sectors can significantly enhance the achievement of SDG targets, providing a strong return on investment.

The Earth Observation [EO] sector plays a pivotal role in climate change mitigation by offering critical 
data for monitoring deforestation, land-use changes, and rising sea levels (\cite{anderson_2017}). However, as EO becomes more industrialized (\cite{venkatesan_2020}), 
it presents several significant environmental risks that must be considered when evaluating its contribution to climate adaptation (\cite{crisp_2020}).

\section*{Comparison}
Here, make the necessary comparisons based on the criteria from the Methods section. Discuss how different nations/regions/sectors perform according to these criteria. You may break this into subsections if there are multiple comparisons.

\section*{Discussion}
Synthesize the information you gathered from the comparisons. Discuss patterns, insights, and important findings based on the comparisons made.

\section*{Conclusion}
Summarize the main conclusions of your evaluation. Reflect on what the comparisons suggest about the criteria and any recommendations based on the results.
