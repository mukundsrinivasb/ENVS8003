\section*{Introduction}

The World Economic Forum (\cite{masterson_2024})  outlines six key technologies critical for climate change adaptation, including the powerful roles of Earth Observation [EO] and Artificial Intelligence [AI]. EO technologies allow for real-time monitoring of environmental changes, such as deforestation, urbanization, and rising sea levels, offering critical data to enhance climate resilience (\cite{anderson_2017}). AI can help process this vast amount of EO data, identify patterns, and generate predictive models, which can support better decision-making in areas like disaster risk management and agricultural planning (\cite{Huntingford_2019}).

However, the significant role that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays in global emissions—over 3\% of carbon emissions (\cite{jones_2018}) highlights a pressing concern— \textbf{How are major tech companies confronting their environmental responsibilities}. While AI and EO tools offer potential benefits in mitigating climate change, their carbon costs are often overlooked. For instance, AI models require massive computational power, and EO platforms consume vast amounts of energy through cloud-based infrastructure (\cite{taddeo_2021}).

Given the dual role of ICT as both a key driver of climate change solutions and a contributor to global carbon emissions, it is crucial to examine the adaptation strategies that tech companies are adopting to mitigate their environmental impact. While AI and EO technologies are instrumental in addressing climate change, their environmental costs must be carefully considered alongside their benefits. Since no specific framework currently exists to evaluate these strategies in the tech sector, we must rely on established climate change metrics to ensure these companies' adaptation policies align with broader sustainability goals. To this effect, we will employ the techniques outlined in the framework provided by the International Institute for Environment and Development (\cite{craft_2016})  to guide our evaluation of adaptation strategies.

\section*{Methods}
Describe the criteria being used for the evaluation in this section. Include a brief overview of the selected nation/region/sector and explain why this particular area was chosen for the evaluation.

\section*{Comparison}
Here, make the necessary comparisons based on the criteria from the Methods section. Discuss how different nations/regions/sectors perform according to these criteria. You may break this into subsections if there are multiple comparisons.

\section*{Discussion}
Synthesize the information you gathered from the comparisons. Discuss patterns, insights, and important findings based on the comparisons made.

\section*{Conclusion}
Summarize the main conclusions of your evaluation. Reflect on what the comparisons suggest about the criteria and any recommendations based on the results.
