\section*{Introduction}
% \subsection*{Background}

The World Economic Forum (\cite{masterson_2024})  outlines six key technologies critical for climate change adaptation, 
including the powerful roles of Earth Observation [EO] and Artificial Intelligence [AI]. 


\subsection*{Earth Observation}
EO sector plays a pivotal role in climate change adaptation by offering critical data for monitoring deforestation, land-use changes, and rising sea levels (\cite{anderson_2017}). 
The EO technologies are essential for tracking progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (\cite{unitednations_2015}), particularly in providing spatially explicit data to monitor targets across 
a wide range of SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals]. EO supports informed decision-making by governments and international 
organizations, allowing for better resource management and monitoring of the impact of climate mitigation strategies.
However, as EO becomes more industrialized (\cite{venkatesan_2020}) , it presents several significant environmental risks  
that must be considered when evaluating its contribution to climate adaptation (\cite{crisp_2020}). \\
While EO transitions to a more cloud-based data processing model, it introduces significant environmental 
considerations within the environmental science community. Storing and distributing EO data relies heavily on a global network of data centers, 
which are known to contribute substantially to carbon emissions and disproportionately use water resources. Despite these impacts, the specific 
environmental footprint of EO data centers remains opaque and requires critical assessment alongside its contributions to climate adaptation.(\cite{wilkinson_2024})

\subsection*{Artificial Intelligence}
AI models require immense computational power and their energy demands continue to grow exponentially (\cite{amodei_2018}),
 their potential contribution to carbon emissions becomes a significant concern (\cite{taddeo_2021}). Nonetheless, leveraging AI’s 
 expanding capabilities to improve climate change mitigation is both feasible and crucial. 
 For instance, AI can be used to better understand the impacts of industrial production, construction, 
 and transportation on climate change, while also estimating the effectiveness of policy interventions such 
 as carbon taxes and carbon trading systems. However, ensuring the sustainable and equitable deployment of these 
 AI-driven solutions will require robust governance frameworks (\cite{taddeo_2021}).

 The  Information and Communication Technology [ICT] sector that encompasses EO and AI
is responsible for over 3 percent of the world's carbon emissions (\cite{jones_2018}) . Specifically , 
companies like Samsung and Amazon had a footprint of around 40,000MT of \(CO_2\) equivalent in 2021 (\cite{navarro_2023_the}) —raises the question 
of how big tech companies are addressing their environmental impact. While AI and EO tools offer potential benefits in 
mitigating climate change, their carbon costs are often overlooked.

Given the complexity of assessing the environmental impact of EO data collection (\cite{wilkinson_2024}) and storage coupled with the challenges in calculating AI's carbon 
footprint (\cite{Henderson_2020}) , accurately evaluating the broader environmental effects of the ICT sector is particularly difficult. In this context, we aim to systematically 
assess the environmental reports of major tech companies, including Meta, Apple, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, Samsung, as well as satellite companies like Planet Labs. 
The methodology for this evaluation is discussed in detail below, focusing on established climate change metrics and best practices for sustainability reporting.

%% Methods
\section*{Methods}
Earth Observation [EO] plays a vital role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the 2030 Agenda. EO technologies help track, monitor, 
and report progress toward these goals by enabling data-driven decision-making, improving the accuracy of national statistics through spatially explicit data, and 
addressing cross-cutting themes such as climate and energy. The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) is pivotal in ensuring EO's practical application in 
supporting the 2030 Agenda, particularly through partnerships, as emphasized in Strategic Development Goal 17. EO's contributions to national planning and fostering 
synergy between various development sectors can significantly enhance the achievement of SDG targets, providing a strong return on investment.


\section*{Comparison}
Here, make the necessary comparisons based on the criteria from the Methods section. Discuss how different nations/regions/sectors perform according to these criteria. You may break this into subsections if there are multiple comparisons.

\section*{Discussion}
Synthesize the information you gathered from the comparisons. Discuss patterns, insights, and important findings based on the comparisons made.

\section*{Conclusion}
Summarize the main conclusions of your evaluation. Reflect on what the comparisons suggest about the criteria and any recommendations based on the results.
