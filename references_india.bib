	abstract = {We explore the current (1958–2005 period) and near future (2006–2050 period) teleconnections between El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Basin Mode (IOBM), and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) as simulated in historical and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5) simulations of 32 coupled models that participated in the phase five of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). A set of 16 CMIP5 models out of 32 models, which perform best to simulate tropical climate variability in recent decades, is first selected using a robust method based on the Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis for detailed analysis. Most of these models show modest capability in reproducing the seasonal cycle of ENSO types in the current period. Further, amplitude of Indian Ocean (IO) modes is overestimated by the 16 models along with large inter-model spread. Based on these results, a subset of 9 models is formed, which simulate a realistic seasonal phase-locking of ENSO for a robust assessment of future teleconnections. No significant change in El Niño amplitude is detected in near future. However, the IOBM is projected to be weaker during late spring and early summer. The IOD is projected to be stronger during boreal summer in the future relative to the current period. We also investigate if there are any changes from historical to RCP 8.5 simulations in the strength of the IO negative feedback on ENSO with a multiple linear regression approach. The IO negative feedback strengthens significantly in the RCP8.5 scenario due to the increasing role of IOBM in speeding the transition from El Niño to La Niña, despite its reduction of amplitude. In contrast, IOD loses its predictive value in the future projections.},

	isbn = {978-3-319-77276-9},
	abstract = {Climate change is projected to exacerbate intensity of tropical cyclonic storms in selected ocean basins with the rise in sea surface temperatures. Almost all of the tropical cyclonic storms are concentrated in the East Asia, North America, and the Central American regions. The North Indian Ocean—the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, generates only 7\% of the world's cyclones. However, their impact is comparatively high and devastating, especially when they strike the East Indian and Bangladesh coasts bordering the North Bay of Bengal due to high population density clustered around low lying areas along these coastlines. The tropical storms typically do not reach a high intensity in the Arabian Sea due to the unfavorable wind shear; dry air feed from Thar Desert and relatively lower sea surface temperatures. However, the Arabian Sea basin has also produced a few strong tropical cyclones particularly as seen in the recent years. In general, cyclones in North Indian Ocean tend to peak during May, October and November. This paper presents comprehensive analyses of the cyclonic disturbances data of the North Indian Ocean of 140 years (1877–2016) and investigates the likely impacts of climate change on tropical cyclones frequency and intensity on Indian coasts based on historical cyclone data and recent model based findings on plausible changes in Indian Ocean SSTs and circulation systems.},

	abstract = {Global warming has adversely affected the climatic systems on the earth. Long-term alterations in global weather patterns, particularly rise in global temperature have been significantly influencing the hydrological patterns leading to climate change. One of the biggest challenges posed by the global warming-induced climate change is its direct effect on the well-being of humans through the changes in hydrological cycle affecting the sectors such as agriculture, industrial growth, hydropower generation, domestic water supply etc. Subsequently, the researchers have predicted that impacts of climate change such as the melting of glaciers, increased frequency of floods and droughts, changes in evapotranspiration, variations in surface runoff and rising sea level have significant implications to water resources. Developing economies like India are highly vulnerable to these changes as the majority of its population is dependent on agriculture. In addition to the above the increasing water needs for domestic and industrial purposes, depleting groundwater levels and surface water pollution have been stressing the policymakers for sustainable water resource management. The present research exhaustively reviews the influence of climate change on hydrological components, its qualitative and quantitative implications to surface and groundwater resources in Indian scenario through various case studies. The research also proposes the corrective measures for the impact minimization on the available water resources in the present context.},

This transformation is unique as it will come at the time when the impacts of, as well as the global momentum to respond to, climate change heighten. India’s urban transformation will, therefore, have deep implications for not only local welfare and environmental conditions but also for climate mitigation and climate adaptation. As most of urban India is yet to be built, India has a unique opportunity to lock-in low-carbon, resilient, and equitable urban forms for the long term. This chapter discusses the evolution of India’s urban climate actions, from addressing climate risks to, more recently, mitigation, while also exploring the governance characteristics of these actions. These actions, while nascent, provide an indication that the future trajectory of urban responses to climate change will be shaped by how local development and climate goals will be linked and prioritized.}",

abstract = {India is a rapidly developing economy with interrelated air quality, sustainable development, and climate change mitigation goals. There are unique challenges to achieving each of these goals as well as potential tradeoffs among them. This study examines the implications of possible future energy, climate, and air pollution control policies and measures in India through 2050. We take a scenario approach using the GCAM global energy-climate-land model combined with the Hector simple climate model and the TM5-FASST air quality source-receptor model to examine energy, climate and air quality outcomes. Reducing use of traditional biomass in buildings can reduce primary carbonaceous particulate emissions well below 2015 levels. However, policies that are more ambitious than current plans would likely be required to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions well below 2015 levels. Among single policy cases considered, pricing of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and expansion of natural gas infrastructure have the largest impacts on overall energy system changes relative to the reference scenario. Ambitious air pollution control and GHG policies lead to the largest reductions in air pollution concentrations and radiative forcing, respectively. However, ambitious air pollution control and GHG policies differ in the extent to which they support or impede other policy objectives. Forcing increases due to reduced aerosols from ambitious air pollution policies can be mitigated, at least in part, by applying air pollution control and GHG policies together.}

The projected precipitation climatology was translated into the change in drought climatology using the effective drought index. The results of the models were consistent in that they project an increase in the mean and the standard deviation of precipitation over most of Asia, and the increase was considerably greater in higher latitude areas. Therefore, it is expected that in future, drought over most of Asia will occur less frequently with weaker intensity and shorter duration than those prevalent currently. However, two special regions were detected. One was the Asian monsoon regions (AMRs: South Asia and East Asia), which showed a greater increase in the standard deviation of precipitation than the mean precipitation, with an amplified seasonal precipitation cycle. As a result, part of the AMRs exhibited slight increases in drought properties such as frequency and intensity. The other region was West Asia. The region showed decreased mean precipitation, especially in its northern part (Syria and its vicinity), and more frequent droughts were projected for this region with enhanced drought intensity and lengthened drought duration. The worsening trends in drought patterns over both regions were more significant in extreme drought, the likelihood of which is relatively higher in summer in West Asia and from spring to summer in the AMRs.},

The model performance has been evaluated in terms of prediction of the flood characteristics such as peak discharge, flood duration, arrival time of flood wave, timing of the peak flow and number of flood waves per season. Future changes in the flood wave characteristics of the basin have been evaluated using the validated model with bias-corrected future-projected meteorological scenario from a regional climate model (RCM). Likelihood analysis of the simulated flow time series reveals that significant increase in both peak discharge and flood duration is expected for both the pre-monsoonal and monsoonal seasons in the basin, but the number of flood waves per season would be reduced. Under the projected climate change scenario, it is expected that there will be more catastrophic floods in the basin.},

Both models and historical data suggest that temperatures have increased in most parts of India, affecting the hydrologic cycle through decreased Himalayan snowpack, increased evaporation, and evapotranspirative demand by vegetation. In contrast, there are uncertainties about the climate–rainfall relationship. While most climate models predict intensification of the Indian monsoon, past rainfall trends suggest a weakening and a regional redistribution, perhaps due to local factors such as aerosols, land use change, and sea surface temperatures. Translating these uncertain projections to water availability is complicated by sparse hydrologic records and human modifications of catchments. Empirical research suggests that climate change is not the only stressor. As climate and socio-economic futures are interlinked, this requires participatory, adaptive management and mainstreaming of adaptation across agencies.},
